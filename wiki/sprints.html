                    <h2>Sprints</h2>
                    <p>If you would like to run a Sprint or have an idea for a Sprint that you think that others would like to join, please add it below.</p>
                    <p>Please add your name to the table of participants for the Sprints that you would like to attend. You do not need to comitt to attend the Sprint for the whole time, you can drop in and out to take in the other elements of the conference. The attendance lists below will help us to plan which rooms to use for which Sprints.</p>

                    <h2>What is a Sprint?</h2>
                    <p>A Sprint is a get-together of people involved in a project or those that wish to get involved. It gives an opportunity for focused development on the project and is a great opportunity for people to immerse themselves in a project to a much greater level than a conventional talk.</p>
                    <p>Sprints are organized around the ideas of the Extreme Programming discipline of software development. The sprint is directed by the coach, who suggests tasks, tracks their progress and makes sure that no one is stuck. Most of the development happens in pairs.</p>
                    <p>We will provide rooms and communication support.</p>
