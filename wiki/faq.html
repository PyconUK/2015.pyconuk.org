                    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                    <p>Here we list questions we have been asked via email or elsewhere.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Do I need to bring my EventBrite ticket with me ?</dt>
<dd>Yes, if you want to be entered into the Prize Draw</dd>


<dt>I'm a speaker and preparing my slides, what is the projector resolution ?</dt>
<dd>You can assume a minimum of 1024x768. Each room has a projector and/or flat screen. Please test your laptop with the room projector well before your talk : if you have problems we have our own projectors which can be pressed into service.</dd>
<dt>How can I book my place at Pycon UK</dt>
<dd>We are using EventBrite to handle all our bookings. Please visit the Pycon UK Registration Page.</dd>
<dt>I have had trouble booking</dt>
<dd>I click to finish my booking, the browser goes away saying 'Processing...' and doesn't come back. Help!<br /><br />
Try clearing your browser cache and history, then try again. If the problem persists contact us at Pycon UK-adm -AT- python -DOT- org, and we will get EventBrite support to look at it.</dd>

<dt>Is the Conference Dinner halal?</dt>
<dd>No. The two basic options are Vegetarian or Omnivore
the Omnivore option is not halal (but see below)
The Vegetarian option is not Vegan ( but see below )
Nor is the menu Kosher ( but see below! )
If you let us know of any special dietary requirements, they will be met, for example if you want halal mail us at Pycon UK-adm@python.org and you we will make sure that you have a halal meal from halal-certificated sources.</dd>

<dt>I booked for Pycon UK, but now I can't come. Can I get a refund?</dt>
<dd>We can refund you 80% of the full ticket price you paid, that is we charge a 20% cancellation fee. However, we will not be able to issue refunds after 10th September except in the most exceptional circumstances (e.g. bereavement) as we are fully committed on expenditure with the venue, having given them final numbers and we simply do not have the time at such a late stage.</dd>

<dt>Do I have to take my laptop there?</dt>
<dd>That's up to you : it's not essential unless you're going to a Workshop, Tutorial or Sprint. Most people take their laptops. The wifi access should be good.</dd>

<dt>Is there a timetable?</dt>
<dd>The 'official' timetable will be made available at the actual weekend itself.</dd>

<dt>Who are the speakers and their topics?</dt>
<dd>The speakers and workshop leaders will be the brightest and best of the UK Python community and may also feature speakers from abroad. Looking at the links above may give you a clue to the sort of people who might speak (hopefully new people will speak also).<br />
To see an unofficial list of talks which will evolve over the weeks ahead, look at Talks and Workshops</dd>

<dt>What are the concessions?</dt>
<dd>Discounts are availble for students, nurses, 16-18s, over 65s, registered unemployed and holders of an NHS maternity exemption card. Please bring proof of status to the conference with you. Note that this rate does not include the conference dinner.
We also have discounts for:
<ul><li>Accepted Speakers and Early Bird, and Teachers attending the whole conference. Early Bird means you trust us to put on an interesting conference without seeing the final schedule.
<li>Teachers attending the Education Track
<li>School children attending the Education Track</ul>

To book at concession rates, please contact Pycon UK-adm@python.org for details.</dd>

<dt>Why don't speakers get free entry?</dt>
<dd>Because we cannot afford it, sorry. Pycon UK is a not-for-profit volunteer-run conference where the all the delegates are active and interesting people. Therefore the majority of delegates are organisers, speakers, workshop leaders, session chairs. If we let everyone in free then we cannot cover costs. The biggest cost is food, if we do not provide food in the venue then we lose several hours of interesting conference time while people get lost around the city.</dd>

<dt>When does the early bird rate finish?</dt>
<dd>The last day you can purchase early bird tickets is 1st May 2014.</dd>
