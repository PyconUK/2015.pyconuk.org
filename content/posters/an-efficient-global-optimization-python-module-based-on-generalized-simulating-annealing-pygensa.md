Many problems in statistics, finance, biology, pharmacology, physics, mathematics, economics, and chemistry involve determination of the global minimum of multidimensional functions.
Python modules from SciPy and PyPI for different stochastic methods (i.e: pyEvolve, basin-hopping) implementation,
have been developed and successfully used in the Python scientific community.
Based on Tsallis statistics, the pyGenSA python module has been developed for generalized simulated annealing to process complicated non-linear objective functions with a large number of local minima.
Testing pyGenSA, pyEvolve, basin-hopping (SciPy) on many standard test functions for optimization problems shows that pyGenSA performed the best.
