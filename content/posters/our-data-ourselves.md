The "Our Data Ourselves" project at King's College London's Department of Digital Humanities developed an Android app called MobileMiner to track the behaviour of other apps on smartphones issued to twenty volunteers from Young Rewired State. Python has featured heavily in all stages of our work. The data was captured using the Python-based data portal CKAN, analysed using scikit-learn, and returned to the volunteers using an Ipython notebook inside a Docker container. Now, we are experimenting with its ethical dissemination using MIT's Open Personal Data Store, also Python-based.
