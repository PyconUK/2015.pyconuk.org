### Erick Martins Ratamero

We are investigating the role of broadcasters (i.e. media, political parties, advertisers, etc) on forming opinions in a population. With a two-layered approach, broadcasters can adopt simple strategies to maximise profit, votes or any given metric, based on the current state of the public opinion and the strategies of the other broadcasters. This is a new model that can shed some light on why broadcasters adjust their discourse and what are the consequences for the public opinion.
