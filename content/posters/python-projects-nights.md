### Sandy Walker

An introduction to London Python Project Nights:
- What is it?
- Why is it?
- How to get involved/find out more

Emphasis on the poster will be given to what and why London Python Project Nights is, and how it came to be.

Hopefully this will encourage people who have been meaning to make a start on that big idea they had or are looking to contribute to something but need that little extra bit of motivation to get started.
