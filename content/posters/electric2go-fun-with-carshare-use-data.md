### Jarek Pi√≥rkowski

Show off ideas behind my project https://github.com/jarek/electric2go :

- data collecting from a set of different APIs and processing into a consistent format for comparison
- how maps and statistics like in http://piorkowski.ca/rev/2015/02/a-week-of-car2go-in-canada/ can be created
- how videos like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbR3t9KbC4M can be created
- what this data can tell us about systems' usage patterns and indirectly about cities they serve: density, parking availability, etc
