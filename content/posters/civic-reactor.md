### Colin Moore-Hill

Following last years lightening talk with 3 gadgets, about the Establishment and large consultancies. I have/am trying started a charitable Not for profit thing with some like minded people to attempt to make the provision of it services of the people for the people by the people.  Focused on utilising the hackaton concept to create a network of code cells, to support their local government and charities. and where possible to share knowledge, best practice and of course code.
