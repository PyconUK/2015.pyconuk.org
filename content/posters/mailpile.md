Mailpile is a new open-source desktop e-mail client, which can also serve as a personal web-mail server.

Mailpile is combines a back-end search- and e-mail engine written Python with a web-based user interface. The project places great emphasis on usability and privacy, in particular attempting to make OpenPGP usable by non-technical people and attempt to give people a realistic alternative to storing all their e-mail in a corporate cloud.
