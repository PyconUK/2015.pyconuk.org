### Stewart Adcock

The Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) is the comprehensive, public collection of 800,000 curated small molecule organic and organo-metallic crystal structures and is an essential resource to scientists around the world. Exploration and application of the knowledge derived from these crystal structures is possible with a powerful and widely-used suite of software tools, the Cambridge Structural Database System (CSDS).

In order to provide more flexible access to the CSD and the C++ toolkit upon which the CSDS software tools are built, we developed the CSD Python API. It contains elegant, expressive and easy to use modules for crystal structure search, retrieval, analysis and manipulation. The API encapsulates complexities in the underlying software and, for the most part, offers the same level of encapsulation for common chemical structure and crystal structure file formats.

Aside from offering a convenient mechanism for accessing the CSD data programmatically, functionality offered by the API includes: molecule editing, geometry analysis, conformer generation, interaction analysis, molecular similarity, field-based ligand screening, and more.

This poster will describe the technology behind the CSD Python API and highlight some of the scientific tools made possible. The poster will explain how the CSD Python API is revolutionising state-of-the-art structural chemistry research by show-casing some of the real-world problems tackled in recent months.
