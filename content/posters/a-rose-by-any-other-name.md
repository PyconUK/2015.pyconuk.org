### Gail Ollis

I research how programmers' work is affected by the decisions of their peers. In my poster I focus on one issue commonly reported by my participants: the impact of variable names. The issue is explained so that even absolute newcomers to programming can see the important role that human aspects play. Experienced programmers will recognise all too readily the problems set out on the poster. I hope it will also pique their curiosity about my other findings and how they are being applied; I'll be delighted to discuss the work with them.
