<h2>PyCon UK Returns!</h2>

<p>PyCon UK, the community organised conference for the Python programming
language in the United Kingdom, returns on Friday 16th - Monday 19th
September 2016.</p>

<p>
<!-- TODO: Intro paragraph -->
</p>

<p>For the fifth year in a row, there will be an education track - we
look forward to welcoming teaching colleagues and the young
Pythonistas of tomorrow. We will also be joined by
DjangoGirls and Trans*Code - both of whom will be providing Python
training for new members of our community.</p>

<!-- INFO: Track name TBD -->
<p>Following the success of 2015, we will be running another track for Python
users in research and data science.  This time we've called it a <em>RSE (Research
Software Engineer) Track</em> in recognition of that fact that RSEs in the humanities
and arts are active and welcome in our community. </p>

<p>If you'd like to contribute, volunteer or help in any other way with
PyCon UK (which is completely organised by volunteers) then get in
touch via the <a href="https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/pyconuk">
conference mailing list</a>.</p>
