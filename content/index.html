<h2>PyCon UK Returns!</h2>

<p>PyCon UK, the community organised conference for the Python programming
language in the United Kingdom, returns on Friday 18th - Monday 21st
September 2015.</p>

<p>As last year, it will be held at the Coventry University Technology
Centre and include the usual smörgåsbord of talks, tutorials,
workshops and keynotes. As in previous years there will be the hugely
popular social events too: a conference meal, a charity social event
on Friday evening (in aid of Cancer Research UK) and the famous
corridor track.</p>

<p>For the fourth year in a row, there will be an education track - we
look forward to welcoming teaching colleagues and the young
Pythonistas of tomorrow. This time we will also be joined by
DjangoGirls and Trans*Code - both of whom will be providing Python
training for new members of our community.</p>

<p>We're also very excited to announce a new string to our bow: the
Scientific Python track for, er, Scientists who use Python. Be amazed
at how Python is helping us learn about and understand the world
around us.</p>

<p>Finally, this year's PyCon UK will be tinged with sadness as we
inevitably remember John Pinner, our illustrious conference chair and
founder of PyCon UK who recently lost his fight with cancer. Our
tribute to John will be to make this the best PyCon UK yet - and that
can only happen with your support.</p>

<p>If you'd like to contribute, volunteer or help in any other way with
PyCon UK (which is completely organised by volunteers) then get in
touch via the <a href="https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/pyconuk">
conference mailing list</a>.</p>
