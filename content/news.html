    <h2>Poster Session</h2>

    <p><small>5th June 2015</small></p>

    <p>And now for something completely different - the PyCon UK Poster
    Session!</p>

    <p>We are pleased to announce the very first PyCon UK poster session. Poster
    sessions, which are popular at scientific and academic conferences, give
    the presenter a chance to stand in front of a one meter square "poster"
    illustrating their topic, and interact with attendees as they pass by -
    answering questions, trading ideas, etc. in a much more "up close and
    personal" setting.</p>

    <p>Poster sessions are a good way for people to get started presenting at a
    conference, since one is only talking to a few people at a time. They are
    also a good venue for niche projects that might not get on a talk program,
    or for testing the waters with very new ideas.</p>

    <p>This year PyCon UK will be holding its first poster session, accepting up to
    20 posters. For more information, and to find out how to submit a poster,
    please visit the <a href="/posters/">poster session page</a>.</p>
