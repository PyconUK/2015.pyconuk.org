<p>PyCon UK is a hugely popular and oversubscribed conference that
attracts the very best of programming talent from across the UK,
Europe and elsewhere. Our conference is regularly featured in both
the
<a href="http://www.linuxuser.co.uk/news/pycon-uk-is-underway">trade</a>
and
<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/info/developer-blog/2013/oct/03/teachers-students-pyconuk">national</a>
press. Why? Because PyCon UK is organised by the Python community
for the Python community with the support of our sponsors (that's
where you come in).</p>

<p>Your sponsorship helps PyCon UK deliver amazing talks,
tutorials, workshops and community events whilst remaining
accessible to the widest possible audience.</p>

<p>The conference itself will take place over the long weekend of
the 18th-21st September 2015 at the <a href="/venue">Coventry
University Technology Centre</a>. It will include several tracks
of talks, tutorials, keynotes, workshops, an
<a href="/education">education
track</a> aimed at both teachers and kids, a
<a href="/science">science track</a> for those working with Python
in other disciplines, outreach to under-represented groups and
various social events to strengthen our community.</p>

<p>In addition to the specific opportunities listed below, all
sponsors get their logo displayed on the conference website and we
will put any supplied marketing material into the delegate swag
bags and display any provided banners around the conference
venue.</p>

<p>By sponsoring the event you will be engaging with the most
active and influential members of the UK Python community, and
placing your brand to the forefront in the community's activities.
You will also earn glory, and the undying gratitude of the
organisers and delegates. :-)</p>

<p>The available sponsorship is listed below. There are broadly
two ways to sponsor: <a href="#items">sponsor specific activities
or events</a> or <a href="#levels">sponsor at a certain level</a>.
However, we're flexible and would love to hear suggestions for
bespoke sponsorship packages.</p>

<p>All sponsors are eligible to take part, for free, in the
PyCon UK recruitment event. Non-sponsors will need to pay a
fee of &pound;500 (in advance) to take part.</p>
