<ul>
    <li>Learn Python from professional Python programmers.</li>
    <li>Learn to teach Python from experts such as the
<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/resources/teach/">Raspberry Pi Foundation education team</a>,
<a href="http://jam-packed.uk">Jam Packed</a>
and other teaching colleagues.</li>
    <li>Return to your classroom with ideas, contacts, resources and
    confidence.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks to the generous sponsorship of
<a href="http://www.bofaml.com/content/boaml/en_us/home.html">Bank of America Merrill Lynch</a>,
full conference
<strong>tickets for teachers only cost &pound;50</strong> (not including the
conference meal).  We also have <strong>bursaries of &pound;200 per teacher
towards the cost of supply cover at school</strong> - there should be no
financial reason for headteachers to say you can't attend. We've literally
got you covered.</p>

<p>We will be holding a Raspberry Jam where participants of all
ages will get to play, code, learn and share all things
programming in Python on a RaspberryPi and any other device
we can get to work.</p>

<p>We aim to run various workshops aimed
at young beginner Pythonistas throughout the day. These will
include web design, robotics, Minecraft and physical
computing. Our aim is to turn excited kids into exhausted but
inspired proto-programmers. :-)</p>

<p>The cost is only Â£5 per child and parents/guardians get in
for free. <strong><a href="/register">Book here</a></strong>.</p>
