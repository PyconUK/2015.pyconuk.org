<p>If you are a working scientist then this track is for you - whether you have never used Python before and want to dip your toe in the water, or you are a fully-fledged Pythonista, looking to expand your repertoire. The PyCon UK Science Track will offer you three days of learning, collaboration and fun, and a chance to meet other scientists using Python.
</p>
<p>The PyCon UK Science Track will run from Saturday 19th September - Monday 21st.
 feature:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Saturday</strong>
    <ul>
    <li>a keynote from <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/people/ss27739">Simon Sheridan</a>, a developer on the Ptolemy instrument aboard the Rosetta space mission to comet Churyumov-Gerasimenko ('67P').</li>
    <li><em>Tutorials</em> on Python suitable for beginner Python programmers where you can learn to automate common data analysis and visualisation tasks</li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Sunday</strong> talks from other scientists and professional software engineers on Python in science and best practices for developing your own code</li>
    <li><strong>Monday</strong> a collaborative <em>open science sprint</em> where you can bring along code you are working on and we will put you into teams to help improve it. Good tasks to work on might include:
    <ul>
    <li>figuring out whether Python is a good fit for your needs</li>
    <li>speeding-up your code</li>
    <li>writing developer or user documentation</li>
    <li>adding tests to legacy programs</li>
    <li>working out how to use <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a> most effectively (other version control systems are available)</li>
    <li>packaging your software so that it can easily be installed </li>
    </ul>
    Our friends from <a href="http://www.overleaf.com">Overleaf</a> will be joining us for this, they run a  collaborative cloud service for LaTeX users (think: Google docs for LaTeX) which has a very simple push-to-submit service for a number of Open Access journals and open science services, such as
    <a href="http://f1000research.com/contact">F1000</a>,
    <a href="http://figshare.com/">Figshare</a>,
    <a href="https://peerj.com/">PeerJ</a>,
    <a href="http://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a> and
    <a href="http://www.nature.com/sdata/">Scientific Data</a>.
    This means that any software or figures you produce on the Monday Sprint can be given a DOI and easily shared with the scientific community.

<h2>Open science</h2>
<p>Why is open science so important to an community like PyCon UK?

Python is <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">Free software</a> which means that anyone who uses Python has a right to modify and redistribute it.
Just like science, software is improved by having many people openly improve on the state of the art.
Python has a reputation for being a productive language, and has had a number of <a href="https://www.python.org/about/success/#scientific">success stories</a> in science and <a href="https://www.python.org/about/success/#engineering">engineering</a>.
At PyCon UK you will find a conference full of people who understand that <a href="http://www.software.ac.uk/policy/manifesto">Reproducible research</a> needs open, <a href="http://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2013-07-09-recomputation-manifesto">recomputable</a> software!
