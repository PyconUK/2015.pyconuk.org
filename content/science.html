<p>If you are a working scientist, data scientist or digital humanities scholar, then this track is for you.
Whether you have never used Python before and want to dip your toe in the water, or you are a fully-fledged Pythonista, looking to expand your repertoire, the PyCon UK Science Track will offer you three days of learning, collaboration and fun, and a chance to meet other researchers using Python.
</p>
<p>The PyCon UK RSE Track will run from Saturday 17th September - Monday 19th <a href="/register">Book now</a> or learn about <a href="#sponsor">sponsorship opportunities</a>.

<h2>Open science</h2>
<p>Why is open science so important to an community like PyCon UK?

Python is <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">Free software</a> which means that anyone who uses Python has a right to modify and redistribute it.
Just like science, software is improved by having many people openly improve on the state of the art.
Python has a reputation for being a productive language, and has had a number of <a href="https://www.python.org/about/success/#scientific">success stories</a> in science and <a href="https://www.python.org/about/success/#engineering">engineering</a>.
At PyCon UK you will find a conference full of people who understand that <a href="http://www.software.ac.uk/policy/manifesto">Reproducible research</a> needs open, <a href="http://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2013-07-09-recomputation-manifesto">recomputable</a> software!

PyCon UK is a community run conference - every delegate has a paid ticket, including the volunteer organisers.
Every year we sell out before the conference, and we are able to put on an amazing weekend of talks, workshops and fun because we have a wonderfully generous group of sponsors.
</p>
<p>
2016 marks the second year that PyCon UK will run a dedicated track for researchers.
Since PyCon UK started, we have accepted a growing number of talks from people working in the sciences and digital humanities, and we expect this trend to continue.
Earlier this year the <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/">PSF</a> and <a href="http://numfocus.org/">NUMFocus</a> announced funding for a new <a href="https://wiki.python.org/psf/ScientificWG">working group</a>, and the future for Python in research seems more assured than ever.
</p>
<p>
PyCon UK has a range of <a href="/sponsor">sponsorship options</a> for organisations who want to support this work and have access to over 300 of the most dedicated Python users in the UK.
Sponsorship opportunities start as low as &pound;1000 for Supporter level sponsors.
In particular, we are keen to find someone to sponsor <strong>payment relief for research students</strong>.
Benefits to sponsors include:
<ul>
<li>sponsor logos will be displayed on the conference website</li>
<li>any supplied marketing material will be included in the delegate swag bags and banners may be displayed around the conference venue</li>
<li>All sponsors are eligible to take part, for free, in the PyCon UK recruitment event (non-sponsors will need to pay a fee of Â£500, in advance, to take part)</li>
