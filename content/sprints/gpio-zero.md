### GPIO Zero

While the existing GPIO (general purpose input output) library for Raspberry Pi is excellent and featureful, it was not designed for children. The "hello world" program of physical computing (flashing an LED) requires several obscure lines.

An effort to create a simple interface to everyday components has been started. Examples were demonstrated to teachers on Friday at PyConUK which was well received and suggestions for naming conventions were discussed.
