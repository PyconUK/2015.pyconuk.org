### Christian Murphy

Cards Against Online is a tornado based attempt to clone Cards Against Humanity and let people play games via their browser together,
the sprint is supported by myself, and I will be getting people up to speed on the code base and what we can do to improve that will matter most

from the readme, a REALISTIC agenda:
- Make a new web server just for interfacing with the game logic and running a game locally for people on the same server, no account stuff, just load up, connect players, enter your name and go.
- Finish the game logic
- Make a Python Programmers Against Humanity Deck for testing!

If that all sounds like fun, come help out!
