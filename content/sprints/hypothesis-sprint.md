[Hypothesis](http://hypothesis.readthedocs.org/),  as seen in the "Finding more bugs with less work" talk, is
a great testing library which you should absolutely be using.

Lets test things with it! Bring along your open source projects you want to be better tested, and we'll try to
test them using Hypothesis.
