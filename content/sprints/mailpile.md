### Bjarni R. Einarsson

[Mailpile](https://www.mailpile.is/) is a personal web-mail project
focusing on privacy and security. Our long-term goal is to provide
a user-friendly answer to the question:

> "How can I make my e-mail more secure?"

The focus of this sprint will inevitably depend on who shows up, but
things we could do include:

   * Check out the code and get it up and running for development
   * Identify bugs in our "getting started" documentation
   * Impromptu usability tests: your confusion can make Mailpile better!
   * Explore Mailpile's fledgeling plug-in API

The project has a whole bunch of [low hanging fruit
issues](https://github.com/mailpile/Mailpile/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Low+Hanging+Fruit%22)
which we could try to fix.
