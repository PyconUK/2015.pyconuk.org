My daughter plays with Scratch 1.4, and all the schools and Raspberry
Pi Foundation etc seem to too. It is a very nice program but this
original version of Scratch was first released in 2003 and Scratch 1.4
was released on July 19, 2009.

After that, they abandoned it and started work on Scratch 2.0 is in
Flash and I don't personally care for it at all.

How hard would it be to re-implement Scratch in Python? I have been
asking several people for their ideas during the conference and have a
partial understanding. Come and we can get started.
