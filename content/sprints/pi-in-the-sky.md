### Raspberry Pi Foundation

We recently ran [Skycademy](https://twitter.com/hashtag/skycademy) and trained 24 educators to fly high altitude missions using the Raspberry Pi and [Pi in the Sky](http://www.pi-in-the-sky.com/) board.

During PyCon UK we are aiming to launch a High Altitude mission and talking with teachers about how this kind of project could engage their learners. We want to develop a Python library / tool to replicate the functionality of the existing C library but make it easier for learners to access the coding side of the project. During this sprint we want to add features to give greater control to those who want to undertake their own missions.
