<h2>Call For Participation</h2>

<h3>Call for Lunchtime Events</h3>

<p>Due to the constantly growing number of delegates, this year we
have a two hour lunch break and each delegate is assigned a 30 min
slot to be in the restaurant. To make good use of the other hour and a
half, we have asked you, the PyCon UK community, to organise events in
the track rooms.</p>

<p>These need to be informal events that can handle people dropping in
and out. Examples may include 'birds of a feather' sessions, discussions,
special interest groups, demonstrations/install-fests/helpdesks for
particular software libraries etc.</p>

<p>It is allowed and encouraged for generally applicable lunchtime
events to be held twice i.e. 12pm on one day, 1pm on another (for
example, see the code clinic in the schedule) or across a whole two
hour slot (for example, see the poster session in the schedule).</p>

<p>To submit a proposal for a lunchtime event, please fill out the
form below.</p>
