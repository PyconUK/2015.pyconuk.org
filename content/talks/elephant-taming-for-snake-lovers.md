PHP is one of the most popular web development platforms in the world.
Like it or not you can't argue with the widespread usage and popularity of PHP, from CMSs, to forums, eCommerce sites and more, there's a lot of actively developed/used code out there. 

Follow along with me as I attempt to explain the most appealing features, similarities, galloping differences between PHP and Python, and why you should care:

 - Similarities (generators, traits, functional, modules).
 - Managing dependencies and distributing packages with Composer.
 - Debugging locally and remotely with XDebug.
 - Pick a framework, really, any framework.
 - Deploying apps with mod_php and php-fpm (We don't need no WSGI here).
 - Documentation, sometimes *global everything* has good consequences.
 - Migrating between versions, alternative implementations (from HHVM to HippyVM) and the future(s) of PHP, 7 and Hack.
