### Daniele Procida

Computing power is a kind of power, but I’m interested in a more powerful power: power over other people.

I want to understand power and where it comes from. I’m curious about the balances and imbalances of power in our worlds of software development, how it moves around and where it goes. I want to know how it affects the people who have it, how they use it, and whether they even realise that they hold it.

I believe that it really matters to open-source communities, that it’s poorly understood, and that not understanding it has harmful consequences for us.
