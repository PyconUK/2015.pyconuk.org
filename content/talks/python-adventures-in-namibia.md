In February this year, with the help of the University of Namibia and Cardiff University's Phoenix Project, and with support from numerous organisations in the Django/Python community, we held Python Namibia, a four-day international software conference in the capital, Windhoek.

This is the story of why we did it, how we did it, how it went - and what's going to happen next.
