Schedule
========

The dynamic conference for the leading dynamic language
-------------------------------------------------------

PyCon UK is an informal yet exciting mix of talks, tutorials,
workshops, keynotes, socials, plenary hi-jinks, five minute 'lightning
talks' and more.

Please see our `YouTube channel`_ to see a few of the things we got up
to last year.

Friday has talks and workshops from Python experts from the UK and
further afield as well as a special `Python in Education`_
track. The day will be rounded off with a bring-your-own buffet charity
event in memory of John Pinner (all proceeds to be donated to Cancer
Research UK).

Saturday contains more talks, workshops and networking but also the
Lightning Talk Man takes flight and the kids outsmart us all in the
special Children's Track, the science track begins and all this is
followed by the PyCon UK Conference Dinner.

Sunday contains the PyCon UK Panel, a 'Question Time' style event
where you can ask leading Python developers questions on Python,
developing and the meaning of life. Lightning Talk Man continues to
inspire and entertain and we hold the all-important PyCon UK jobs fair
where you can recruit or be recruited from a pool of the highest
quality UK developers.

Monday is the Sprint day, we split into small groups and in each group
a member of an Open Source Python project guides a small group in how
to hack on the project. Improve your Python skills in a fun, practical
and effective way.

The schedule below is provisional. The skeleton will become
increasingly fleshed out during the run up to the
conference. However, once decided the schedule *will NOT change except
in extremely special circumstances*.
