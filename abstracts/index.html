<div class="section" id="accelerating-scientific-code-with-numba">
<span id="numba"></span><h2>Accelerating Scientific Code with Numba</h2>
<p><em>Graham Markall, Continuum Analytics</em></p>
<p>This tutorial will provide an overview of Numba, a just-in-time Python
compiler focused on numerical computing. Originally aimed at
computations using Numpy arrays, it has been expanded to work with
other Python types and can speed up computations that require more
than just fast linear algebra operations. Numba targets both CPUs and
CUDA GPUs by generating native code using the LLVM compiler
infrastructure.</p>
<p>This introduction aims to span the breadth of use cases rather than
focusing on a single area in depth. This is in order to enable the
selection of appropriate portions of code to use with Numba, and the
correct selection of Numba's facilities in each case.</p>
<p>Areas that will be covered include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>An overview of the type system, with a view to understanding and overcoming typing issues,</li>
<li>Compilation of Python functions using the &#64;jit decorator,</li>
<li>Creation of Numpy ufuncs in Python using the &#64;vectorize decorator,</li>
<li>Understanding the performance of compiled code, and performance optimisation tips,</li>
<li>Debugging facilities in Numba.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This tutorial is intended for an audience of programmers and data
scientists who have an interest in speeding up numerical routines, and
people with a general interest in high-performance Python. In order to
get started quickly, it is recommended that attendees install the
Anaconda Python distribution or Miniconda, as this provides a robust
mechanism for installing Numba on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="getting-started-with-testing-scientific-programs">
<span id="testing"></span><h2>Getting started with testing scientific programs</h2>
<p><em>Martin Jones, University of Edinburgh</em></p>
<p>When writing programs for scientific research, we tend to be focussed
on getting results, so testing is generally not a priority. Often,
this means that our data-processing pipelines end up incorporating
programs that don't have test suites. Examples of
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/314/5807/1856.full">high-profile retractions due to software errors</a>
illustrate the dangers of this approach.</p>
<p>This session will be a gentle introduction to testing, aimed at people
writing scientific software who would like to start taking advantage
of automated testing. We'll start with Python's built-in tools and
moving on to using the Nose testing framework. We'll look at the
problems that testing can solve, and see some best-practises for
writing tests.</p>
<p>The goal of this training session is for attendees to come away
with:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>an understanding of some basic testing concepts,</li>
<li>some hands-on experience of running tests and interpreting the output, and</li>
<li>an idea of how to start applying these tools to their own projects.</li>
</ol>
<p>Attendees should have a basic knowledge of Python and should be
familiar with the idea of functions, conditions and exceptions. They
should also have the Nose package installed (pip install nose should
work in most cases).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tit-for-tat-evolution-game-theory-and-the-python-axelrod-library">
<span id="titfortat"></span><h2>Tit for Tat, Evolution, Game Theory and the Python Axelrod Library</h2>
<p><em>Vince Knight, Cardiff University</em></p>
<p>This talk will begin with the origin of species. More precisely with a
discussion of Darwin's theory of evolution and how Game Theory has
been used to explain/illustrate aspects of cooperation in complex
dynamics.</p>
<p>In 1980, Professor Robert Axelrod created a computer tournament
inviting submissions of code snippets that would compete against each
other. A large amount of academic study has concentrated on the
outcomes of this experiment. The particularity of the outcome, was
that even when the tournament was repeated with a much larger number
of strategies, a very simple strategy was victorious: Tit for
Tat. This strategy tries it's best to cooperate with other strategies!</p>
<p>The talk will briefly discuss all of this but will concentrate on a
new Python library (pip install axelrod). This project, hosted on
github allows anyone to recreate the tournament but also (and arguably
more importantly) submit strategies via pull request!</p>
<p>It is anticipated that this talk would be appreciated by coders of all
levels as it gives a very low entry level for a contribution to an
open source project. It should also be of interest to the more
experienced coders as it is hoped that novel strategies will be
devised and submitted. Indeed, historically strategies have been
mainly devised by mathematicians and economists, surely the pyconuk
attendees will bring something new to the repository?</p>
<p>Finally, for those who are perhaps not interested in 'playing along'
the talk will also describe the newest addition to the project which
is a Django project aiming to bring this study of evolution to a
popular audience.</p>

<span id="ship"></span><h2>Ship Data Science Products!</h2>
<p><em>Ian Ozsvald, ModelInsight.io</em></p>
<p>Building and shipping working Data Science and scientific products is
hard - learn from 10 years of Ian's experience at ModelInsight.io to
find efficient ways through the mess of bad data, complicated data
workflows and weakly designed code through to successfully deployed
projects.</p>
<p>This talk will include ways of getting data, cleaning and debugging
it, approaches to deployment and various tips I've picked up along the
way that'll save you lots of time.</p>
<p>If you're fresh out of academia and want to do science then this will
open your eyes to how 'stuff works in industry'. If you're in a
growing data science team and you want to do more science and spend
less time fighting fires - this talk is definitely for you. Be more
effective, stop fighting fires and burning time.</p>
<p>Ian Ozsvald is co-founder of the 1,500+ member PyDataLondon meetup and
conference series, a published O'Reilly author, international speaker
and teacher and he runs a 10 year old Data Science consulting group in
London (ModelInsight.io).</p>

<div class="section" id="ice-interactive-cloud-experimentation">
<span id="ice"></span><h2>iCE: Interactive cloud experimentation</h2>
<p><em>George Lestaris, Pivotal</em></p>
<p>In the cloud-computing era, many technologies like Puppet, chef,
ansible, etc arose to take care of setting up, maintaining and
provisioning virtual machine clusters. However these tools do not
prove to be practical for cases where the user wants to test a
deployment or try a small experiment involving many VMs in the
cloud. Additionally they lack interactiveness and the user is unable
to hijack or influence the deployment process during runtime.</p>
<p>Python iCE is a tool that aims to enable interactive cloud
experimentation. It can deploy VM clusters in EC2-compatible public
clouds and allow the user to manage them through SSH. It formalises an
experiment as a Python script with fabric tasks which can run on every
or selected VMs in a cluster.</p>
<p>It also integrates with IPython and it has its own shell that allows
for interactive handling of the VMs. iCE is built with
well-established Python libraries like IPython, boto and fabric.</p>
<p>iCE comes with a lightweight agent that registers a VM to an
experiment's pool. This agent will run automatically for VMs deployed
with iCE but users can manually run it on already running VMs to
utilise them through iCE.</p>
<p>It's IPython shell facilitates the development and execution of
experiments. Its main goal is to bring the ease of use and
interactiveness of single-machine SSH sessions to virtual clusters.</p>

<div class="section" id="power-python-in-astronomy">
<span id="power"></span><h2>Power: Python in Astronomy</h2>
<p><em>Tomas James, Cardiff University</em></p>
<p>The universe is a wild and wonderful place. From the quantum
mechanical effects that power the Sun, to the gravitational effects
that suck everything in to a black hole, one thing links them all:
they can all be analysed using Python.</p>
<p>Python's clear syntax and extensibility makes it an incredibly usable
and streamlined language for scientists. We'll cover off exactly how
scientists use Python, what Python can do that other languages can't,
and just how you can use a simple Python script to generate beautiful
astronomical images from the comfort of your favourite armchair.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pythons-and-earthquakes">
<span id="earthquakes"></span><h2>Pythons and Earthquakes</h2>
<p><em>Girish Kumar, Uprise Marketing</em></p>
<p>In this session, we will cover how Python is used in providing
near-real-time maps of landslide hazard following large
earthquakes. Our tool is called 'shakeslide' for post-disaster
response, analysis and research and I will discuss the process of how
a research paper was converted into a functional web application</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="getting-meaning-from-scientific-articles">
<span id="meaning"></span><h2>Getting meaning from scientific articles</h2>
<p><em>Eleonore Mayola, ClojureBridge</em></p>
<p>The bibliography process means every scientist regularly has to go
through a lot of published articles in parallel to her/his
research. The aim is 1) to know what other researchers are doing: they
might be ahead of you, they might have proven your project is a dead
end, 2) get some context to interpret your research results. Using
specialised search engines can be inefficient if you don't use the
&quot;right&quot; keywords. Researcher also tend to find bibliography boring so
it would be interesting to automate part of the process!</p>
<p>In my talk I'll answer the following question: can Python machine
learning libraries (nltk, scikit-learn) be used to determine whether a
research article is worth reading? I'll use the Natural Language
Processing to identify articles topics and train a classifier to
distinguish between relevant and non-relevant articles depending and
someone's area of research.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="demo-simple-web-services-for-scientific-data">
<span id="demo"></span><h2>Demo: Simple web services for scientific data</h2>
<p><em>Alys Brett, Culham Centre for Fusion Energy</em></p>
<p>Would you like to let people access your data over the web or generate plots on
the fly when someone loads a web page? This session will introduce the benefits
of creating web services for accessing scientific data and let you try out the
basics for yourself.</p>
<p>It is now common for online companies to provide programmatic access to data -
web APIs where data resources in many forms can be accessed via a URL. This
approach can be very useful for scientific data too. One benefit is that you
don't have to worry about what platforms and languages to support - the data can
be used by anything that can make HTTP requests. You might think that creating
this kind of web service is solely the preserve of professional engineers but,
with the power of Python, this is changing. There are very convenient packages
(such as Flask and Requests) that make it incredibly simple to get started.</p>
<p>The session will start with a demonstration of some web services we've developed
for nuclear fusion data from the JET experiment, including a plot server and a
data browsing tool. This will be followed by a mini-tutorial to help you get
started with harnessing the power of HTTP web services.</p>
