<p>PyCon UK is a community conference, run by unpaid
volunteers. But we need your help! We'd love you to get
involved and join the fun!</p>

<p>To sign up as a volunteer you need to
<a href="/register">purchase a "community" ticket</a>
and select the appropriate contribution you wish to
make as a volunteer.</p>

<p>You have four options each of which will require only
around two hours of your time over the duration of the
whole conference:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Session Chairs</strong> - responsible for
    the smooth running of sessions. You will be given a
    simple checklist of what to do. We expect you to chair
    two one-hour sessions and we'll negotiate which ones
    once the talk schedule is published.</li>
    <li><strong>Stage Hands</strong> - put stuff up and
    take stuff down! You'll be busiest on Thursday
    evening, Friday Morning and Sunday afternoon. You'll
    set out chairs, set up computers for workshops, put up
    signs and make sure everything is in the right place
    at the right time. We expect you to spend an hour of
    your time on two separate days. You'll get a checklist
    of stuff to move, setup, take down at certain times
    per day.</li>
    <li><strong>Meeters and Greeters</strong> - be a
    "people person". Spend an hour on two separate days
    manning registration and/or being posted at busy
    footfall points where you'll be expected to answer
    questions, give directions and manage traffic
    flow.</li>
    <li><strong>Workshop Wizards</strong> - may the source
    be with you! Spend two hours in one of the education
    track workshops such as DjangoGirls, TransCode,
    Teacher training or the kids day.</li>
</ol>
<p>What do you get out of this? A funky special edition
volunteer's t-shirt and a reduced rate ticket! But hurry,
there are only a limited number of tickets available.</p>
