            <h1>Building Async Microservices</h1>

                <h3>Norberto Leite</h3>
<p>Over the course of the 2.5 hours of this workshop you will learn how to leverage both Python and MongoDB to build highly scalable, asynchronous applications based on micro services architecture. We will be building from scratch several different "exotic" services, using a variety of datasets, that together we can mashup into a consolidated application using our own laptops. </p>
<p>We will start by introducing several  technologies that we will be using (e.g. Python, Tornado, MongoDB, AngularJS) and take a ten-thousand foot  overview of micro services architecture.
In the second half of the workshop, we will break into teams that will each take charge in implementing a micro services that will comprise our final application. </p>
<p>This a fully hands-on workshop.</p>
<p>Learning objectives: 
Benefits of micro service architectures
MongoDB schema design 
MongoDB query optimization and profiling 
Basic understanding of AngularJS 
Flask as REST API platform</p>
<p>Target Audience:
This workshop is recommended to software developers eager to understand more about MongoDB and how to build async calls. Coding skills and basic understanding of Python is required. Prior experience with AngularJS and Tornado is welcomed.</p>
<p>Technical Requirement:
The attendee should bring their own laptop with MongoDB and Python (&gt;2.7) installed. One should have administration grants over their system because we will need to expose ports and other communications to the network. The datasets and project instructions will be provided on site.</p>
