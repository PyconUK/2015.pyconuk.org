                <h3>Konark Modi</h3>
<p>In this world of big-data where we are producing data of enormous variety, velocity, volume and the nature being semi-structured we need to put some rules around data being collected which are not rigid yet allow efficient management of it right from collection layer.</p>
<p>My talk is based on first-hand experience that me and my team had while writing frameworks and data pipelines , we like anyone else started with collecting data in JSON format. But soon started to run into problems because of systems which were writing the data were abusing the flexibility.</p>
<p>More importantly how we can leverage Python with this and makes it interoperable with various Big Data techologies.</p>
<p>Schemas  / Serialization is a layer not many people talk about , but in my experience it is very useful and one can benefit from it in many many ways.</p>
<p>The agenda of the talk is as follows :</p>
<ol>
<li>Need of a schema / serialization.</li>
<li>Avro and why is it so awesome.</li>
<li>Demo of creating some schemas and showcasing the features.</li>
<li>How Avro serialized data can be used across different layers / tools in the BigData pipeline. Be it Realtime processing system like Kafka with Storm or Batch processing system like Hadoop, Hive etc.</li>
<li>Setting up your AVRO schema repository to help people create, distrubute and manage schemas. A pure Django based implementation.</li>
<li>Do's and Don'ts .</li>
</ol>
<p>Who should Attend :</p>
<p>I plan to keep it beginner friendly, any one who has been or is doing data collection at any level can benefit from this talk. </p>
