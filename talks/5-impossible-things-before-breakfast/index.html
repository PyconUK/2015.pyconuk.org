<p>Sometimes you're asked to deliver something that seems impossible, but
necessary in a given timeframe.  Sometimes it's several seemingly impossible
things.</p>
<p>Developing the prototype for the BBC Micro:bit - a pocket sized, child
programmable computer - was very much like this.  It had 3 months to be
delivered in a form sufficiently robust and usable to be used by children in
schools across the country; to be sufficiently documented to be completely
understood from scratch by others; and to be a sufficiently open and
flexible design to allow any and all parts of the system to change, while
retaining its core principles.</p>
<p>There was about 3 months to develop the entire stack from scratch. This
included a microcontroller based hardware stack, through firmware, a python
to C++ compiler (3-4 weeks), through django website, through to a QT
(PySide) client side application, through to publication of the device as a
network connected and controllable device via REST.  Python was involved in
all layers - including at microcontroller level on a device too small to run
any python interpreter.</p>
<p>The bulk of the development period had just one developer for hardware
and software.  For just 1 month there were 2 extra developers brought on
board, part time to assist.</p>
<p>This talk will be a detailed overview of the various subsystems, and the
strategies taken to deliver a complete, mass produce-able, and sufficiently
scalable product such an aggressive timescale.  The talk title is a nod to
the idea that while each of the various layers is doable alone in 3 months,
doing all the layers simultaneously using one developer is ... challenging.</p>
<p>It should be of interest to those interested in developing hardware and
software products, and especially those developing products that have both a
hardware and software element.</p>
