<p>My daughter plays with Scratch 1.4, and all the schools and Raspberry
Pi Foundation etc seem to too. It is a very nice program but this
original version of Scratch was first released in 2003 and Scratch 1.4
was released on July 19, 2009.</p>
<p>After that, they abandoned it and started work on Scratch 2.0 is in
Flash and I don't personally care for it at all.</p>
<p>How hard would it be to re-implement Scratch in Python? I have been
asking several people for their ideas during the conference and have a
partial understanding. Come and we can get started.</p>
