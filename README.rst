This is the website for PyCon UK. It is hosted via GitHub Pages and available via http://pyconuk.org/.

We welcome pull requests for improvements! (Please see CONTRIBUTING.rst_ for details.)

Use the following process to submit changes:

* Fork the repository.
* Create a descriptive branch name for the change you are proposing.
* Make your changes and test that nothing is broken, as described below.
* Push your changes in your local branch back to your remote GitHub repository.
* In GitHub, create a pull request from your branch against our upstream repository.
* Someone (not you) will check the change and either merge it (thus automatically updating the website) or add comments for further changes or a reason for rejection.

If you're not a coder please feel free to create issues here: https://github.com/PyconUK/pyconuk.org/issues

That's it!

Development
~~~~~~~~~~~
This site uses wok_.  To install wok and other dendencies, run ``pip install -r requirements.txt``.

wok builds the site by assembling several components:

* Pages are found in ``content/``.  Pages may be HTML, Markdown_ or reStructuredText_, and contain some YAML metadata.
* Static files are found in ``media/``.
* A jinja2_ template for all the pages is found in ``templates/default.html``

To build the site, run ``make build``.  This will pull together all the componenents into a set of HTML files in ``output/``.

Windows users: you need to run the (extensionless) ``wok`` script in c:/pythonxx/scripts. eg ``py -2 c:\python27\scripts\wok``.

Alternatively, if you run ``make serve``, wok will build the site, serve the built site on port 8000, and watch for changes.

Windows users: you need to run the (extensionless) ``wok`` script with the --serve parameter in c:/pythonxx/scripts. eg ``py -2 c:\python27\scripts\wok --serve``.

You can test that the site contains no broken links and that the conference name is capitalised correctly (hint, it's "PyCon UK") by running ``make test``.

Travis will test branches, and branches won't get merged without review and passing tests, so dive right in!


Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~

The site is hosted as a Project Page on GitHub Pages, and so it is the ``gh-pages`` branch of the repository that gets served.  wok generates the site in the ``output/`` directory, and Travis is configured to push any changes to the ``output/`` directory to this branch.  See ``deploy.sh`` for details.

This should be done automatically by Travis after it has built the ``master`` branch, but in case this does not happen, somebody with commit access to the repository can run ``make deploy``.
