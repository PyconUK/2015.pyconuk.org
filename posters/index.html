                        <h1>Poster Session</h1>

<p>A poster is a poster sized graphical summary of the key points about your project which forms the starting point for a brief and interactive presentation to interested viewers. The presentation space will be at least large enough to display a one meter square poster or equivalent individual pages.</p>

<p>The poster session provides another way of presenting that encourages more <b>one-on-one communication</b> between the presenter and the audience. Poster sessions are particularly suited for topics of interest to a subset of the community, and we anticipate this session will provide an "incubator" for further discussions.</p>

<h2>Call for Posters</h2>

<p>To submit a poster proposal, visit the <a href="/programme/">Call for Participation</a> and fill out the form.</p>

<p>Posters will be accepted for the poster session on a rolling basis until 1 August or the limit of 20 posters is reached.</p>

<p>If your questions still aren't answered feel free to email <a href="mailto:naomi.ceder@gmail.com">Naomi Ceder</a>.</p>

<h1>Poster session questions and answers</h1>

<h2>Q: What is a poster session?</h2>

<p>A: A poster session is a plenary session where each speaker is given space to display their work as a poster. During the session, speakers stand with their posters, and the audience circulate freely, seeking out the particular presentations they are interested in and talking directly to the presenter in small groups. For PyCon UK 2015, we will have a designated plenary poster session and will be providing space for posters on meter square in size. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dyzaZjwdfE" alt="This video">This video</a> will give you an idea of what poster sessions are.</p>

<h2>Q: What makes a good poster presentation?</h2>

<p>A: First, a good proposal. Poster sessions are intended to give you the chance to present interesting ideas and start conversations with others. Additionally, proposal titles and abstracts are one of the major tools the audience will use to identify posters of interest, so it is important to communicate clearly.</p>

<p>Second, the poster itself. It is important to understand that a poster is neither a paper nor a slideshow. The poster isn't there for the audience to just read, it is a visual aid for you to use in creating a quick engaging impromptu presentation, and to refer to in answering questions and fueling discussion. Use this session as a way to make connections with people that you can continue through the open spaces or informally during the conference.</p>

<h2>Q: Can I submit both a poster and a talk proposal?</h2>

<p>A: Absolutely! We encourage everyone to submit a poster proposal even if they have also submitted a talk proposal. Even if a talk proposal can not be accommodated by the program committee, it may still be well suited for a poster presentation.</p>
