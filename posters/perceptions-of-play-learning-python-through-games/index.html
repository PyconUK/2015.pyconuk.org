            <h1>Perceptions of Play: learning Python through games</h1>

            <div class="textblock">
                <h3>Corinne Welsh</h3>
<p>We learn best when we are relaxed, curious and enjoying ourselves. This poster will invite you to consider the importance of play in adult learning and the value of lifelong learning. It will look at the process of learning Python by building games. It will encourage you to consider the ideas of success and failure (winning and losing).</p>
<p>Making a game is a highly achievable goal for the beginner programmer. You do not need to know a lot of Python to make a game that is fun to play. And without knowing anything about programming, playing a game can be an accessible way to understand how programs work.</p>
<p>We will explore what is good design and how to develop these elements simply. There will be examples of games, which are within the reach of a novice programmer to design and build. The poster will help identify resources for learning and developing Python skills, including: practice opportunities, libraries, and useful programming concepts. Although my primary interest is adult learning, much of the discussion will be relevant to younger learners and teachers.</p>
<p>I plan to demonstrate a game to illustrate the poster's concepts. The game will have input and output interaction using a Raspberry Pi and basic electronics. Come and play!</p>
